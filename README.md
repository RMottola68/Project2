# Project2
Jquery / API

Ryan Mottola

This project is only meant to be a basic search engine using the giphy api. It's my first experience combining jquery with other languages, as well as basic api documentation.

If you type a keyword into the search field, and click the search button, the giphy server will return all related results. There is a breakpoint starting at tablets, moving to bigger screens. 

Technologies used: html, css/ bootstrap, javascript/ jquery. The style.css file was used VERY minimally. 

Future Improvements:
1) I'd like to program the collapsing navbar to add a larger padding-top as it expands, so it doesn't cover any elements.
2) I very badly would like to make the enter key function properly, but it seemed to be a greater challenge than expected. (The page kept refreshing/ submitting instead of simply activating the search button.
3) I've been told that jquery is not the optimal solution for backend programming, so eventually I'd like to bypass it using straightforward javascript.

User Stories:

1) As a human on planet Earth, I want to search a library of gifs so that I can communicate my thoughts and feelings.

2) As a collector of fine memes, I'd like to be able to search up gifs at any given moment, so that I can share them with acquaintances.
